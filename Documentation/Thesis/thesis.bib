abstract = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation and therapy has become more and more frequently used to help the elderly, disabled patients or movement disorders to perform exercise and training. The field of robot-assisted lower limb rehabilitation has rapidly evolved in the last decade. This article presents a review on the most recent progress (from year 2001 to 2014) of mechanisms, training modes and control strategies for lower limb rehabilitation robots. Special attention is paid to the adaptive robot control methods considering hybrid data fusion and patient evaluation in robot-assisted passive and active lower limb rehabilitation. The characteristics and clinical outcomes of different training modes and control algorithms in recent studies are analysed and summarized. Research gaps and future directions are also highlighted in this paper to improve the outcome of robot-assisted rehabilitation.},

@book{Chisholm2010,
abstract = {For those suffering from neurological disorders or injuries, regaining lost motor function is an important component of the rehabilitation process. Instead of using compensatory methods such as walking aids or wheelchairs, modern approaches to gait rehabilitation focus on training the patient to relearn how to walk and robotics are being introduced to enhance this therapy. The potential of new approaches to gait rehabilitation motivated the design of a novel robot called the Virtual Gait Rehabilitation Robot (ViGRR) to be developed at the Advanced Biomechatronics Laboratory (ABL) at Carleton University. This thesis is a presentation of the design and implementation of a scaled prototype robot as a test platform for ViGRR. The design process of the ViGRR prototype was initiated with the formulation of the robot configuration and controller concept. The kinematic and dynamic models of the robot and a human leg were then derived, where the leg model and average gait trajectories were used to determine the requirements for the device. Through an iterative detailed design procedure, the robot design parameters were optimized and the drive units and control apparatus were selected and implemented. A robot simulation was created and the complete system was realized with hard real-time control software written for performing trajectory tracking and force control. Kinematic and dynamic calibrations and tracking experiments were carried out and the results demonstrated good performance using a model-based nonlinear robot controller. A tracking task involving the user manipulating the robot in force control mode and visual feedback demonstrated the system's ability to implement a control scheme analogous to the ViGRR rehabilitation-focused control concept for the full scale device. The system realization for the ViGRR prototype presented in this thesis provides a platform for research into new control strategies for gait rehabilitation.},

@article{Hebert2016,
abstract = {Stroke rehabilitation is a progressive, dynamic, goal-orientated process aimed at enabling a person with impairment to reach their optimal physical, cognitive, emotional, communicative, social and/or functional activity level. After a stroke, patients often continue to require rehabilitation for persistent deficits related to spasticity, upper and lower extremity dysfunction, shoulder and central pain, mobility/gait, dysphagia, vision, and communication. Each year in Canada 62,000 people experience a stroke. Among stroke survivors, over 6500 individuals access in-patient stroke rehabilitation and stay a median of 30 days (inter-quartile range 19 to 45 days). The 2015 update of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations: Stroke Rehabilitation Practice Guidelines is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for all members of multidisciplinary teams working in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. These recommendations have been developed to addre...},
