abstract = {1. Abstract This paper describes the PHANToM haptic interface-a device which measures a user's finger tip position and exerts a precisely controlled force vector on the finger tip. The device has enabled users to interact with and feel a wide variety of virtual objects and will be used for control of remote manipulators. This paper discusses the design rationale, novel kinematics and mechanics of the PHANToM. A brief description of the programming of basic shape elements and contact interactions is also given. 2. Introduction A dominant focus in robotics research labs has traditionally been the development of autonomous systems-those which operate without human supervision or interaction. However, robotic systems which are under direct human control have begun to enjoy a resurgence of interest in recent years, in part due to advances in robot and human interface technologies. These new interactive systems (telerobotic) promise to expand the abilities of humans, by increasing physical strength, by improving manual dexterity, by augmenting the senses, and most intriguingly, by projecting human users in to remote or abstract environments. In this paper we focus on our work to develop a means for interacting with virtual mechanical objects; this is an important stepping stone toward the development of enhanced remote manipulation systems in which simultaneous interaction with real and virtual objects will be possible. At the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, we have been developing haptic interface devices to permit touch interactions between human users and remote virtual and physical environments. The Personal Haptic Interface Mechanism, PHANToM, shown in Figure 1, has evolved as a result of this research (Massie, 1993). The PHANToM is a convenient desktop device which provides a force-reflecting interface between a human user and a computer. Users connect to the mechanism by simply inserting their index finger into a thimble. The PHANToM tracks the motion of the user's finger tip and can actively exert an external force on the finger, creating compelling illusions of interaction with solid physical objects. A stylus can be substituted for the thimble and users can feel the tip of the stylus touch virtual surfaces. By stressing design principals of low mass, low friction, low backlash, high stiffness and good backdrivability we have devised a system capable of presenting convincing sensations of contact, constrained motion, surface compliance, surface friction, texture and other mechanical attributes of virtual objects. 3. Three Enabling Observations Three observations influenced the basic design of the PHANToM. The first observation established the type of haptic stimulation that the device would provide, the second determined the number of actuators that the device would require and the third established the volume or workspace that the device would possess. 1. Force and motion are the most important haptic cues. A significant component of our ability to "visualize", remember and establish cognitive models of the physical structure of our environment stems from haptic interactions with objects in the environment. Kinesthetic, force and cutaneous senses combined with motor capabilities permit us to probe, perceive and rearrange objects in the physical world. Even without detailed cutaneous information (as with a gloved hand or tool), the forces and motions imparted on/by our limbs and fingers contribute significant information about the spatial map of our environment. Information about how an object moves in response to applied force and the forces which arise when we attempt to move objects can provide cues to geometry (shape, locality, identity), attributes (constraint, impedance, friction, texture, etc.) and events (constraint, change, contact, slip) in the environment. Unlike other sensory modalities, haptic interactions permit two-way interaction via work exchange. Controlled work can be performed on dynamic objects in the environment and modulated to accomplish tasks. 2. Many meaningful haptic interactions involve little or no torque. Perhaps the most significant design feature of the PHANToM is the passive, 3 degree-of-freedom "thimble-gimbal", shown in Figure 2. The decision to use the},

abstract = {Stair climbing up and down is an essential part of everyday's mobility. To enable wheelchair-dependent patients the repetitive practice of this task, a novel gait robot, G-EO-Systems (EO, Lat: I walk), based on the end-effector principle, has been designed. The trajectories of the foot plates are freely programmable enabling not only the practice of simulated floor walking but also stair climbing up and down. The article intended to compare lower limb muscle activation patterns of hemiparetic subjects during real floor walking and stairs climbing up, and during the corresponding simulated conditions on the machine, and secondly to demonstrate gait improvement on single case after training on the machine. The muscle activation pattern of seven lower limb muscles of six hemiparetic patients during free and simulated walking on the floor and stair climbing was measured via dynamic electromyography. A non-ambulatory, sub-acute stroke patient additionally trained on the G-EO-Systems every workday for five weeks. The muscle activation patterns were comparable during the real and simulated conditions, both on the floor and during stair climbing up. Minor differences, concerning the real and simulated floor walking conditions, were a delayed (prolonged) onset (duration) of the thigh muscle activation on the machine across all subjects. Concerning stair climbing conditions, the shank muscle activation was more phasic and timely correct in selected patients on the device. The severely affected subject regained walking and stair climbing ability. The G-EO-Systems is an interesting new option in gait rehabilitation after stroke. The lower limb muscle activation patterns were comparable, a training thus feasible, and the positive case report warrants further clinical studies.},

However based on the same audit, no corresponding improvement has been effected to patient functional impairment levels on hospital discharge in the corresponding time frame. This study derived patient-to-therapist ratios as a means of exploring the amount of rehabilitation time for stroke patients while in hospital care. Method: A purpose specific survey was developed for completion by stroke teams. From a contact list compiled primarily in collaboration with the 28 National Stroke Improvement Networks, the N th name technique was used to target stroke teams in each geographical area covered by the 28 networks. Results: A total of 53 surveys were returned representing 20 of the 28 network areas providing 71{\%} national coverage. Analysis conducted on 19 of the 37 inpatient hospital care units that were discrete units, had no missing data for staff numbers, unit bed numbers, number of stroke patients treated per annum, average unit length-of-stay, and unit occupancy rates. Staffing levels for some therapies were below the Department of Health staffing assumptions suggesting that stroke units are challenged to provide the recommended therapy time. Conclusions: Most stroke units surveyed are operating below the DH staffing assumption levels and are therefore challenged in providing the amount of therapy and patient time recommended in the National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines to facilitate optimal functional recovery for stroke patients.},

@article{Dobkin2004,
abstract = {Rehabilitation after hemiplegic stroke has typically relied on the training of patients in compensatory strategies. The translation of neuroscientific research into care has led to new approaches and renewed promise for better outcomes. Improved motor control can progress with task-specific training incorporating increased use of proximal and distal movements during intensive practice of real-world activities. Functional gains are incorrectly said to plateau by 3–6 months. Many patients retain latent sensorimotor function that can be realised any time after stroke with a pulse of goal-directed therapy. The amount of practice probably best determines gains for a given level of residual movement ability. Clinicians should encourage patients to build greater strength, speed, endurance, and precision of multijoint movements on tasks that increase independence and enrich daily activity. Imaging tools may help clinicians determine the capacity of residual networks to respond to a therapeutic approach and help establish optimal doseresponse curves for training. Promising adjunct approaches include practice with robotic devices or in a virtual environment, electrical stimulation to increase cortical excitability during training, and drugs to optimise molecular mechanisms for learning. Biological strategies for neural repair may augment rehabilitation in the next decade.},

Decades of basic science have clearly demonstrated the capacity of the central nervous system (CNS) to structurally and functionally adapt in response to experience. The field of neurorehabilitation has begun to use this body of work to develop neurobiologically informed therapies that harness the key behavioral and neural signals that drive neural plasticity. The present review describes how neural plasticity supports both learning in the intact CNS and functional improvement in the damaged or diseased CNS. A pragmatic, interdisciplinary definition of neural plasticity is presented that may be used by both clinical and basic scientists studying neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, a description of how neural plasticity may act to drive different neural strategies underlying functional improvement after CNS injury or disease is provided. The understanding of the relationship between these different neural strategies, mechanisms of neural plasticity, and changes in behavior may facilitate the development of novel, more effective rehabilitation interventions.},

abstract = {Virtual reality and interactive video gaming have emerged as new treatment approaches in stroke rehabilitation settings over the last ten years. The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality on upper limb function and activity after stroke. The impact on secondary outcomes including gait, cognitive function and activities of daily living was also assessed. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing virtual reality with an alternative intervention or no intervention were eligible to be included in the review. The authors searched a number of electronic databases including: the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, clinical trial registers, reference lists, Dissertation Abstracts and contacted key researchers in the field. Search results were independently examined by two review authors to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 37 randomized or quasi randomized controlled trials with a total of 1019 participants were included in the review. Virtual reality was found to be significantly more effective than conventional therapy in improving upper limb function (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.28, 95{\%} confidence intervals [CI] 0.08 to 0.49) based on 12 studies and significantly more effective than no therapy in improving upper limber function (SMD 0.44 [95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.73]) based on nine studies. The use of virtual reality also significantly improved activities of daily living function when compared to more conventional therapy approaches (SMD 0.43 [95{\%} CI 0.18 to 0.69]) based on eight studies. While there are a large number of studies assessing the efficacy of virtual reality they tend to be small and many are at risk of bias. While there is evidence to support the use of virtual reality intervention as part of upper limb training programs, more research is required to determine whether it is beneficial in terms of improving lower limb function and gait and cognitive function.},

abstract = {Design: Single cases. Objective: To compare the eects of manually assisted locomotor training in paraplegic patients with the automated training by a driven gait orthosis. Setting: ParaCare, University Hospital Balgrist in Zurich, Switzerland. Methods: Treadmill training with manual assistance and by a driven gait orthosis was applied to two spinal cord injured patients. The {\textregistered}rst patient had an incomplete lesion at C3, the second a complete lesion at C5. They were selected by convenience sample. The EMG activity of the leg muscles rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medials (GM) and tibialis anterior (TA) was visually compared for the two training methods. GM and TA activity was also quanti{\textregistered}ed by calculating the variation ratio between the EMG of the patients and a set of healthy subjects. Results: No signi{\textregistered}cant dierence between the two training methods was found according to the leg muscle EMG activity. Conclusion: Neuronal centers in the spinal cord become activated in a similar way by the manually assisted and the automated locomotor training. With the driven gait orthosis training sessions can be prolonged and workload of therapists can be reduced, and therefore, the automated training represents an alternative to the conventional therapy.

@article{Bernhardt2004,
abstract = {Background and Purpose-One way that stroke units may improve outcome is by reducing complications of immobility through early mobilization; however, this intervention needs testing. The purpose of this study was to determine the physical activity patterns of stroke patients managed within acute stroke units as a first step in developing an early mobilization protocol. Methods-We recruited 64 patients within 14 days after stroke from 5 metropolitan stroke units and observed them for 2 consecutive days at 10-minute intervals between the hours of 8 AM and 5 PM. At each observation, we ascertained physical activity, location, and other person(s) present. Therapists recorded therapy details. Results-The 58 patients who completed the study had a mean age of 71.3 years. Stroke severity ranged from mild (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 1) to severe (score, 27), and mean time after stroke at observation was 5.6 days (range, 0 to 13 days). Only 9 patients were restricted to bed. During the therapeutic day, patients spent 50{\%} resting in bed, 28{\%} sitting out of bed, and only 13{\%} engaged in activities with the potential to prevent complications and improve recovery of mobility. Patients were alone 60{\%} of the time. Conclusions-This is the first multicenter study of physical activity early after stroke. We believe the next step is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of increased levels of physical activity early after stroke compared with current standards of care.},

abstract = {Lang CE, MacDonald JR, Reisman DS, Boyd L, Jacobson Kimberley T, Schindler-Ivens SM, Hornby TG, Ross SA, Scheets PL. Observation of amounts of movement practice provided during stroke rehabilitation. 

OBJECTIVE
To investigate how much movement practice occurred during stroke rehabilitation, and what factors might influence doses of practice provided. 

DESIGN
Observational survey of stroke therapy sessions. 

SETTING
Seven inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation sites. 

PARTICIPANTS
We observed a convenience sample of 312 physical and occupational therapy sessions for people with stroke. 

INTERVENTIONS
Not applicable. 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We recorded numbers of repetitions in specific movement categories and data on potential modifying factors (patient age, side affected, time since stroke, FIM item scores, years of therapist experience). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize amounts of practice. Correlation and regression analyses were used to determine whether potential factors were related to the amount of practice in the 2 important categories of upper extremity functional movements and gait steps. 

RESULTS
Practice of task-specific, functional upper extremity movements occurred in 51{\%} of the sessions that addressed upper limb rehabilitation, and the average number of repetitions/session was 32 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=20–44). Practice of gait occurred in 84{\%} of sessions that addressed lower limb rehabilitation and the average number of gait steps/session was 357 (95{\%} CI=296–418). None of the potential factors listed accounted for significant variance in the amount of practice in either of these 2 categories. 

CONCLUSIONS
The amount of practice provided during poststroke rehabilitation is small compared with animal models. It is possible that current doses of task-specific practice during rehabilitation are not adequate to drive the neural reorganization needed to promote function poststroke optimally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Early mobilisation after stroke is thought to contribute to the effects of stroke-unit care; however, the intervention is poorly defined and not underpinned by strong evidence. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of frequent, higher dose, very early mobilisation with usual care after stroke. METHODS We did this parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial at 56 acute stroke units in five countries. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, first or recurrent, who met physiological criteria were randomly assigned (1:1), via a web-based computer generated block randomisation procedure (block size of six), to receive usual stroke-unit care alone or very early mobilisation in addition to usual care. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was allowed. Randomisation was stratified by study site and stroke severity. Patients, outcome assessors, and investigators involved in trial and data management were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was a favourable outcome 3 months after stroke, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. We did analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12606000185561. FINDINGS Between July 18, 2006, and Oct 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 2104 patients to receive either very early mobilisation (n=1054) or usual care (n=1050); 2083 (99{\%}) patients were included in the 3 month follow-up assessment. 965 (92{\%}) patients were mobilised within 24 h in the very early mobilisation group compared with 623 (59{\%}) patients in the usual care group. Fewer patients in the very early mobilisation group had a favourable outcome than those in the usual care group (n=480 [46{\%}] vs n=525 [50{\%}]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0{\textperiodcentered}73, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}59-0{\textperiodcentered}90; p=0{\textperiodcentered}004). 88 (8{\%}) patients died in the very early mobilisation group compared with 72 (7{\%}) patients in the usual care group (OR 1{\textperiodcentered}34, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}93-1{\textperiodcentered}93, p=0{\textperiodcentered}113). 201 (19{\%}) patients in the very early mobilisation group and 208 (20{\%}) of those in the usual care group had a non-fatal serious adverse event, with no reduction in immobility-related complications with very early mobilisation. INTERPRETATION First mobilisation took place within 24 h for most patients in this trial. The higher dose, very early mobilisation protocol was associated with a reduction in the odds of a favourable outcome at 3 months. Early mobilisation after stroke is recommended in many clinical practice guidelines worldwide, and our findings should affect clinical practice by refining present guidelines; however, clinical recommendations should be informed by future analyses of dose-response associations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Evidence-based stroke care has been shown to improve patient outcomes and may reduce health system costs. Cost savings, however, are poorly quantified. This study assesses 4 aspects of stroke management (rapid assessment and treatment services, thrombolytic therapy, organized stroke units, and early home-supported discharge) and estimates the potential for cost avoidance in Canada if these services were provided in a comprehensive fashion. METHODS Several independent data sources, including the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, the 2008-2009 National Stroke Audit, and the Acute Cerebrovascular Syndrome Registry in the province of British Columbia, were used to assess the current status of stroke care in Canada. Evidence from the literature was used to estimate the effect of providing optimal stroke care on rates of acute care hospitalization, length of stay in hospital, discharge disposition (including death), changes in quality of life, and costs avoided. RESULTS Comprehensive and optimal stroke care in Canada would decrease the number of annual hospital episodes by 1062 (3.3{\%}), the number of acute care days by 166 000 (25.9{\%}), and the number of residential care days by 573 000 (12.8{\%}). The number of deaths in the hospital would be reduced by 1061 (14.9{\%}). Total avoidance of costs was estimated at {\$}682 million annually ({\$}307.4 million in direct costs, {\$}374.3 million in indirect costs). CONCLUSIONS The costs of stroke care in Canada can be substantially reduced, at the same time as improving patient outcomes, with the greater use of known effective treatment modalities.},

In this Review, we aimed to provide an overview of the available evidence on interventions for motor recovery after stroke through the evaluation of systematic reviews, supplemented by recent randomised controlled trials. Most trials were small and had some design limitations. Improvements in recovery of arm function were seen for constraint-induced movement therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, mental practice with motor imagery, and robotics. Improvements in transfer ability or balance were seen with repetitive task training, biofeedback, and training with a moving platform. Physical fitness training, high-intensity therapy (usually physiotherapy), and repetitive task training improved walking speed. Although the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs, some treatments do show promise for improving motor recovery, particularly those that have focused on high-intensity and repetitive task-specific practice.},

The aim of our study was to assess the effects of RAGT on improvement in walking-related functional outcomes in patients with incomplete SCI compared with other rehabilitation modalities according to time elapsed since injury. This review included 10 trials involving 502 participants to meta-analysis. The acute RAGT groups showed significantly greater improvements in gait distance, leg strength, and functional level of mobility and independence than the over-ground training (OGT) groups. The pooled mean difference was 45.05 m (95{\%} CI 13.81 to 76.29, P = 0.005, I2 = 0{\%}; two trials, 122 participants), 2.54 (LEMS, 95{\%} CI 0.11 to 4.96, P = 0.04, I2 = 0{\%}; three trials, 211 participants) and 0.5 (WISCI-II and FIM-L, 95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.98, P = 0.04, I2 = 67{\%}; three trials, 211 participants), respectively. In the chronic RAGT group, significantly greater improvements in speed (pooled mean difference = 0.07 m/s, 95{\%} CI 0.01 to 0.12, P = 0.01, I2 = 0{\%}; three trials, 124 participants) and balance measured by TUG (pooled mean difference = 9.25, 95{\%} CI 2.76 to 15.73, P = 0.005, I2 = 74{\%}; three trials, 120 participants) were observed than in the group with no intervention. Thus, RAGT improves mobility-related outcomes to a greater degree than conventional OGT for patients with incomplete SCI, particularly during the acute stage. RAGT treatment is a promising technique to restore functional walking and improve locomotor ability, which might enable SCI patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase their level of physical activity.

abstract = {Research into rehabilitation robotics has grown rapidly and the number of therapeutic rehabilitation robots has expanded dramatically during the last two decades. Robotic rehabilitation therapy can deliver high-dosage and high-intensity training, making it useful for patients with motor disorders caused by stroke or spinal cord disease. Robotic devices used for motor rehabilitation include end-effector and exoskeleton types; herein, we review the clinical use of both types. One application of robot-assisted therapy is improvement of gait function in patients with stroke. Both end-effector and the exoskeleton devices have proven to be effective complements to conventional physiotherapy in patients with subacute stroke, but there is no clear evidence that robotic gait training is superior to conventional physiotherapy in patients with chronic stroke or when delivered alone. In another application, upper limb motor function training in patients recovering from stroke, robot-assisted therapy was comparable or superior to conventional therapy in patients with subacute stroke. With end-effector devices, the intensity of therapy was the most important determinant of upper limb motor recovery. However, there is insufficient evidence for the use of exoskeleton devices for upper limb motor function in patients with stroke. For rehabilitation of hand motor function, either end-effector and exoskeleton devices showed similar or additive effects relative to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke. The present evidence supports the use of robot-assisted therapy for improving motor function in stroke patients as an additional therapeutic intervention in combination with the conventional rehabilitation therapies. Nevertheless, there will be substantial opportunities for technical development in near future.},

abstract = {Stroke is the second most common cause of death and major cause of disability worldwide. Because of the ageing population, the burden will increase greatly during the next 20 years, especially in developing countries. Advances have occurred in the prevention and treatment of stroke during the past decade. For patients with acute stroke, management in a stroke care unit, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 3 h or aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset, and decompressive surgery for supratentorial malignant hemispheric cerebral infarction are interventions of proven benefi t; several other interventions are being assessed. Proven secondary prevention strategies are warfarin for patients with atrial fi brillation, endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis, antiplatelet agents, and cholesterol reduction. The most important intervention is the management of patients in stroke care units because these provide a framework within which further study might be undertaken. These advances have exposed a worldwide shortage of stroke health-care workers, especially in developing countries. Epidemiology Stroke causes 9{\%} of all deaths around the world and is the second most common cause of death after ischaemic heart disease. 1 The proportion of deaths caused by stroke is 10-12{\%} in western countries, and 12{\%} of these deaths are in people less than 65 years of age. 2 In 2002, stroke-related disability was judged to be the sixth most common cause of reduced disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs-the sum of life-years lost as a result of premature death and years lived with disability adjusted for severity). 3 However, because of the burgeoning elderly population in western societies, the estimation is that by 2030 stroke-related disability in western societies will be ranked as the fourth most important cause of DALYs. 4 Worldwide, stroke consumes about 2-4{\%} of total health-care costs, and in industrialised countries stroke accounts for more than 4{\%} of direct health-care costs.},

@book{Chisholm2010,
abstract = {For those suffering from neurological disorders or injuries, regaining lost motor function is an important component of the rehabilitation process. Instead of using compensatory methods such as walking aids or wheelchairs, modern approaches to gait rehabilitation focus on training the patient to relearn how to walk and robotics are being introduced to enhance this therapy. The potential of new approaches to gait rehabilitation motivated the design of a novel robot called the Virtual Gait Rehabilitation Robot (ViGRR) to be developed at the Advanced Biomechatronics Laboratory (ABL) at Carleton University. This thesis is a presentation of the design and implementation of a scaled prototype robot as a test platform for ViGRR. The design process of the ViGRR prototype was initiated with the formulation of the robot configuration and controller concept. The kinematic and dynamic models of the robot and a human leg were then derived, where the leg model and average gait trajectories were used to determine the requirements for the device. Through an iterative detailed design procedure, the robot design parameters were optimized and the drive units and control apparatus were selected and implemented. A robot simulation was created and the complete system was realized with hard real-time control software written for performing trajectory tracking and force control. Kinematic and dynamic calibrations and tracking experiments were carried out and the results demonstrated good performance using a model-based nonlinear robot controller. A tracking task involving the user manipulating the robot in force control mode and visual feedback demonstrated the system's ability to implement a control scheme analogous to the ViGRR rehabilitation-focused control concept for the full scale device. The system realization for the ViGRR prototype presented in this thesis provides a platform for research into new control strategies for gait rehabilitation.},
