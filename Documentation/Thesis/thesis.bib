abstract = {This paper presents the concept, design process, and the prototype of a novel haptics-based lower-extremity rehabilitation robot for bed-ridden stroke patients. This system, named Virtual Gait Rehabilitation Robot (ViGRR), is required to provide the average gait motion training as well as other targeted exercises such as leg press, stair stepping and motivational gaming, in order to facilitate motor learning and enable the training of daily activities such as walking and maintaining balance. The system requirements are laid out and linked to the design of a redundant planar 4DOF robot concept prototype. An iterative design optimization loop was setup to obtain the robot kinematic and dynamic parameters as well as the actuators. The robot's mechanical design, model, safety features, admittance controllers, and the architecture of the haptic controller are presented. Preliminary experiments were planned and performed to evaluate the capability of the system in delivering task-based virtual-reality exercises and trajectory following scenarios.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Evidence-based stroke care has been shown to improve patient outcomes and may reduce health system costs. Cost savings, however, are poorly quantified. This study assesses 4 aspects of stroke management (rapid assessment and treatment services, thrombolytic therapy, organized stroke units, and early home-supported discharge) and estimates the potential for cost avoidance in Canada if these services were provided in a comprehensive fashion. METHODS Several independent data sources, including the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, the 2008-2009 National Stroke Audit, and the Acute Cerebrovascular Syndrome Registry in the province of British Columbia, were used to assess the current status of stroke care in Canada. Evidence from the literature was used to estimate the effect of providing optimal stroke care on rates of acute care hospitalization, length of stay in hospital, discharge disposition (including death), changes in quality of life, and costs avoided. RESULTS Comprehensive and optimal stroke care in Canada would decrease the number of annual hospital episodes by 1062 (3.3{\%}), the number of acute care days by 166 000 (25.9{\%}), and the number of residential care days by 573 000 (12.8{\%}). The number of deaths in the hospital would be reduced by 1061 (14.9{\%}). Total avoidance of costs was estimated at {\$}682 million annually ({\$}307.4 million in direct costs, {\$}374.3 million in indirect costs). CONCLUSIONS The costs of stroke care in Canada can be substantially reduced, at the same time as improving patient outcomes, with the greater use of known effective treatment modalities.},

abstract = {Loss of functional movement is a common consequence of stroke for which a wide range of interventions has been developed. In this Review, we aimed to provide an overview of the available evidence on interventions for motor recovery after stroke through the evaluation of systematic reviews, supplemented by recent randomised controlled trials. Most trials were small and had some design limitations. Improvements in recovery of arm function were seen for constraint-induced movement therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, mental practice with motor imagery, and robotics. Improvements in transfer ability or balance were seen with repetitive task training, biofeedback, and training with a moving platform. Physical fitness training, high-intensity therapy (usually physiotherapy), and repetitive task training improved walking speed. Although the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs, some treatments do show promise for improving motor recovery, particularly those that have focused on high-intensity and repetitive task-specific practice.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) after spinal cord injury (SCI) induces several different neurophysiological mechanisms to restore walking ability, including the activation of central pattern generators, task-specific stepping practice and massed exercise. However, there is no clear evidence for the optimal timing and efficacy of RAGT in people with SCI. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of RAGT on improvement in walking-related functional outcomes in patients with incomplete SCI compared with other rehabilitation modalities according to time elapsed since injury. This review included 10 trials involving 502 participants to meta-analysis. The acute RAGT groups showed significantly greater improvements in gait distance, leg strength, and functional level of mobility and independence than the over-ground training (OGT) groups. The pooled mean difference was 45.05 m (95{\%} CI 13.81 to 76.29, P = 0.005, I2 = 0{\%}; two trials, 122 participants), 2.54 (LEMS, 95{\%} CI 0.11 to 4.96, P = 0.04, I2 = 0{\%}; three trials, 211 participants) and 0.5 (WISCI-II and FIM-L, 95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.98, P = 0.04, I2 = 67{\%}; three trials, 211 participants), respectively. In the chronic RAGT group, significantly greater improvements in speed (pooled mean difference = 0.07 m/s, 95{\%} CI 0.01 to 0.12, P = 0.01, I2 = 0{\%}; three trials, 124 participants) and balance measured by TUG (pooled mean difference = 9.25, 95{\%} CI 2.76 to 15.73, P = 0.005, I2 = 74{\%}; three trials, 120 participants) were observed than in the group with no intervention. Thus, RAGT improves mobility-related outcomes to a greater degree than conventional OGT for patients with incomplete SCI, particularly during the acute stage. RAGT treatment is a promising technique to restore functional walking and improve locomotor ability, which might enable SCI patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase their level of physical activity.

@article{Chang2013,
abstract = {Research into rehabilitation robotics has grown rapidly and the number of therapeutic rehabilitation robots has expanded dramatically during the last two decades. Robotic rehabilitation therapy can deliver high-dosage and high-intensity training, making it useful for patients with motor disorders caused by stroke or spinal cord disease. Robotic devices used for motor rehabilitation include end-effector and exoskeleton types; herein, we review the clinical use of both types. One application of robot-assisted therapy is improvement of gait function in patients with stroke. Both end-effector and the exoskeleton devices have proven to be effective complements to conventional physiotherapy in patients with subacute stroke, but there is no clear evidence that robotic gait training is superior to conventional physiotherapy in patients with chronic stroke or when delivered alone. In another application, upper limb motor function training in patients recovering from stroke, robot-assisted therapy was comparable or superior to conventional therapy in patients with subacute stroke. With end-effector devices, the intensity of therapy was the most important determinant of upper limb motor recovery. However, there is insufficient evidence for the use of exoskeleton devices for upper limb motor function in patients with stroke. For rehabilitation of hand motor function, either end-effector and exoskeleton devices showed similar or additive effects relative to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke. The present evidence supports the use of robot-assisted therapy for improving motor function in stroke patients as an additional therapeutic intervention in combination with the conventional rehabilitation therapies. Nevertheless, there will be substantial opportunities for technical development in near future.},

abstract = {Stroke is the second most common cause of death and major cause of disability worldwide. Because of the ageing population, the burden will increase greatly during the next 20 years, especially in developing countries. Advances have occurred in the prevention and treatment of stroke during the past decade. For patients with acute stroke, management in a stroke care unit, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 3 h or aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset, and decompressive surgery for supratentorial malignant hemispheric cerebral infarction are interventions of proven benefi t; several other interventions are being assessed. Proven secondary prevention strategies are warfarin for patients with atrial fi brillation, endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis, antiplatelet agents, and cholesterol reduction. The most important intervention is the management of patients in stroke care units because these provide a framework within which further study might be undertaken. These advances have exposed a worldwide shortage of stroke health-care workers, especially in developing countries. Epidemiology Stroke causes 9{\%} of all deaths around the world and is the second most common cause of death after ischaemic heart disease. 1 The proportion of deaths caused by stroke is 10-12{\%} in western countries, and 12{\%} of these deaths are in people less than 65 years of age. 2 In 2002, stroke-related disability was judged to be the sixth most common cause of reduced disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs-the sum of life-years lost as a result of premature death and years lived with disability adjusted for severity). 3 However, because of the burgeoning elderly population in western societies, the estimation is that by 2030 stroke-related disability in western societies will be ranked as the fourth most important cause of DALYs. 4 Worldwide, stroke consumes about 2-4{\%} of total health-care costs, and in industrialised countries stroke accounts for more than 4{\%} of direct health-care costs.},

abstract = {For those suffering from neurological disorders or injuries, regaining lost motor function is an important component of the rehabilitation process. Instead of using compensatory methods such as walking aids or wheelchairs, modern approaches to gait rehabilitation focus on training the patient to relearn how to walk and robotics are being introduced to enhance this therapy. The potential of new approaches to gait rehabilitation motivated the design of a novel robot called the Virtual Gait Rehabilitation Robot (ViGRR) to be developed at the Advanced Biomechatronics Laboratory (ABL) at Carleton University. This thesis is a presentation of the design and implementation of a scaled prototype robot as a test platform for ViGRR. The design process of the ViGRR prototype was initiated with the formulation of the robot configuration and controller concept. The kinematic and dynamic models of the robot and a human leg were then derived, where the leg model and average gait trajectories were used to determine the requirements for the device. Through an iterative detailed design procedure, the robot design parameters were optimized and the drive units and control apparatus were selected and implemented. A robot simulation was created and the complete system was realized with hard real-time control software written for performing trajectory tracking and force control. Kinematic and dynamic calibrations and tracking experiments were carried out and the results demonstrated good performance using a model-based nonlinear robot controller. A tracking task involving the user manipulating the robot in force control mode and visual feedback demonstrated the system's ability to implement a control scheme analogous to the ViGRR rehabilitation-focused control concept for the full scale device. The system realization for the ViGRR prototype presented in this thesis provides a platform for research into new control strategies for gait rehabilitation.},
